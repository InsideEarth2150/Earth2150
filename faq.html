faq:
  - question: What game versions are played in Multiplayer?
    answer: >**[Game Ranger]**
	>> [GameRanger](https://www.gameranger.com/) is the most use method for online multiplayer gameplay. If you do have a troublesome router, you can fix the problem by configuring the router to enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), or manually do port forwarding for UDP port 16000.
	>**[EarthNet/MoonNet]** - _CURRENTLY BROKEN!_
    >>EarthNet/MoonNet is still used by some but predominantly most use GameRanger due its simplified use and the need to not forward ports on most recent routers.
  - question: I can't map gameranger to my install of Earth2150, why?
    answer: To enable GameRanger to see TMP or LS from Steam, you must first move the Game Executable outside of the steam folder structure, if GR is still unable to see the game then COPY the entire game folder to a location outside of the steam folder structure (IE Desktop), however make sure you have fully patched to v2.2 before doing so.
  - question: Ive run the patch intsller but it still shows the same version in game?
    answer: Right click the patch executable and click "Run as Administrator". Make sure you have loaded the game at least once before installing.
  - question: What ports need to be opened/forwarded to play on EarthNet/MoonNet?
    answer: UDP 2300 - 2400 & UDP 47624

  - question: I dont seem to be able to connect to multiplayer games via GameRanger or EarthNet/MoonNet?
