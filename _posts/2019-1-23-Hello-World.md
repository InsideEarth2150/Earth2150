This is a website, who would have guessed. This website is going to be a platform for me to document whatever crap I want to put up on here, so lets see where that gets us. 

So a basic introduction to myself, I am a tikerer by definition:

 Yeah, thats me. I love to mess around with sofware and hardware and learn from it. One example is my [Discord Bot](https://github.com/BorealBlizzard/FinleyBot) project that has been going off and on for a few months, it was my first big idea that I was able to make real and I was able to learn alot of basic JavaScript through it.

If you couldn't tell already im using github pages to host this simple site along with Jekyll.

Im not sure what to type up now but be ready for whatever the heck im going to do next.
